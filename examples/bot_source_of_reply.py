"""
This will show how you could use `message_get` command and the `reply_id` information.

To activate the bot, reply to any message with the text "#top"
If the bot receives such reply, it will look up the original message.
If that is a reply too, it will continue further.
Eventually the bot will reply to the first message the replies are pointing on.
